## Preparing the tomato & lentil sauce
Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add onion, garlic and chili flakes and sauté for a couple of minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir to combine. Cover with a lid and let simmer for about 45 minutes, until the lentils are soft and the sauce is quite ‘dry’.

## Preparing the celeriac and parsnip lasagna noodles
Rinse the roots well, then peel, you might want to use a knife instead of a peeler. Cut the roots in halves (or quarters if it’s large). Slice it in very thin slices, best and easiest done with a mandolin slicer (3 mm slices). Alternatively use a sharp knife, but be careful, and slice as thin as possible.

## Preparing the mushrooms
Clean the mushrooms with a soft brush (baking brush or toothbrush), if they are very dirty wash them with a little water and dry well. Slice the stem and the cap lengthwise into large pieces. Heat oil and garlic in a skillet on medium-high heat, add mushrooms and for a couple of minutes until browned on one side, then stir. Fry for a couple more minutes and pour into a bowl. Now add the thawed spinach to the same skillet with out rinsing. When heated, set aside.

## Assembling the lasagna
In an oven proof dish, start with a thin layer of oil, cover with a layer of root ‘noodles’. Add a layer of half of the tomato sauce and cover with a layer of root ‘noodles’. Add a layer of mushrooms + spinach and a layer of root ‘noodles’. Add a layer of the remaining tomato sauce and arrange the sliced tomatoes on top to cover the tomato sauce. Place the dish in the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes.
