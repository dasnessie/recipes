For the gingerbread recipe, mix the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, spices) and knead with the margarine.

Stir honey and applesauce with a little water until smooth. If the honey is too tough, you can warm it slightly.

Make a dimple in the flour and slowly mix the honey mixture with the flour to form a medium-firm dough. Add a little water or flour as needed until the dough is smooth to shape and roll out.

Let the gingerbread dough rest overnight in the refrigerator.

The next day, roll out the dough with a rolling pin on the floured work surface, about 1 cm thick, and cut out with shapes (traditional shapes are rectangles, hearts, and stars). If desired, press nuts and dried fruit into the dough as garnish.

Bake the gingerbread in the oven at about 180Â° top and bottom heat for about 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the size. Decorate as desired.
