Finely grate 1/3 of the chocolate. Mix with cocoa and chill. Finely chop remaining chocolate.

Whisk margarine until creamy. Sift in powdered sugar and mix in. Add orange zest, juice, vanilla extract and salt and stir in. Sift in flour, stir in briefly, then fold in chocolate chips. Chill dough for 45 minutes.

Form several 4-5 cm thick rolls from the dough, wrap in cling film and chill again for 1-2 hours.

Preheat oven to 200 Â°C top/bottom heat. Take the rolls out of the fridge one by one and roll them in the chocolate-cocoa mix. Using a sharp knife, cut into slices about 1 cm thick and place on a baking sheet with enough space between them. Bake for approx. 12 minutes.
