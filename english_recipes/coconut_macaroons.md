# Coconut Macaroons

**2 trays**

---

- *100 ml* aquafaba (liquid from chickpea can, about 100 ml / 400 g can)
- *130 g* sugar
- *1 tsp* lemon juice
- *1 pinch* salt, if the chickpeas are not salted
- *200 g* grated coconut
- *50 g* vegan dark chocolate

---

Preheat oven to 180 Â°C top/bottom heat.

Mix aquafaba, sugar, lemon juice and salt if desired. Whisk with the whisks of a hand mixer to a stable foam. This may well take 10-15 minutes, depending on the power of the mixer.

Fold in the coconut flakes. Allow the mixture to sit for about ten minutes.

Place macaroons by tablespoonfuls on a baking sheet. Bake in oven for about 12 minutes, until macaroons are lightly browned around the edges. Let cool on a cooling rack.

Melt the chocolate and decorate the completely cooled macaroons with chocolate.
