## Cake base

Knead all ingredients for the dough. Roll it out to the size of the desired shape, put it in the mold, form a rim and put it in the refrigerator for about half an hour. 

Preheat the oven to 180Â°C (convection oven). Remove the dough from the refrigerator and prick the bottom several times with a fork. Bake for about 20 minutes until the dough is golden brown. Let cool.

## Topping

For the topping, mix water, sugar, lemon juice and cornstarch. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add fruit, boil briefly until fruit is just soft or thawed. Allow to cool.

## Filling

Meanwhile, for the filling, place vegetable milk, coconut fat and sugar in a saucepan and heat until fat is melted and sugar is dissolved. Place in a high-powered blender along with the other ingredients and blend on high speed until completely smooth. 

## Assembly

Pour the warm filling into the prepared pie crust and smooth it out. Using a spoon, carefully spoon the berry mixture on top. Let the cake cool completely in the refrigerator, preferably overnight.
