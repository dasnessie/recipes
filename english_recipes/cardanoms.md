Mix flour and semolina and sift into a bowl.

Whisk together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the four-semolina mix.The dough should be slightly dry, don't add any liquids. Let the dough rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 150 Â°C. Form the dough into as many balls as you want cookies. Slightly flatten the cookies and place on a baking sheet. Decorate each cookie with one pumpkin seed and bake the cookies for 30 minutes, until lightly brown. Let cool on a wire rack.
