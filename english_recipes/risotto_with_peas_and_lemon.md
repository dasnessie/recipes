Peel and finely dice onions and garlic. Wash herbs, spin dry and chop finely. Wash the lemon with hot water, zest it and squeeze out the juice.

Prepare the broth. To do this, bring water to a boil in a saucepan, dissolve miso paste in it, and season with vegetable broth powder. Let it simmer, add the broth to the rice ladle by ladle.

Heat margarine in another pot. Sauté onions, then add garlic and sauté briefly. Add rice and brown. 

Deglaze with white wine, simmer, stirring, until liquid evaporates. Then add one to two ladles of broth, stir in, and simmer again, stirring occasionally, until liquid is absorbed. Repeat this process until the rice is almost al dente. Then add the peas and continue adding broth until the rice is just al dente. If the broth is used up too quickly, make more vegetable broth and continue with that.

Stir in lemon zest, yeast flakes and herbs. If more creaminess is desired or the risotto is too sour, dissolve nut butter in a bit of broth to avoid clumps, then stir that in. Season the risotto with nutritional yeast, miso paste, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
