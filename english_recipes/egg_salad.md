Cook the pasta in salted water for about twice as long as indicated on the packet. Blanch the peas. 

Finely dice the gherkins. Cut the cress or cut the chives into small rolls.

For the sauce, mix the mayonnaise, cream, gherkin vinegar and mustard until smooth. Season with turmeric and kala namak.

Drain and rinse the pasta. Mash coarsely with a potato masher or alternatively chop briefly (!) with a food processor. The pieces form the "egg white".

Drain the chickpeas and also mash them with a potato masher. They form the "egg yolk".

Mix all the ingredients together and season with salt, pepper and more kala namak if necessary. Leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes and serve.
