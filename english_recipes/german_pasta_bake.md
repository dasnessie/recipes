First, for the glaze, put the silken tofu in a cloth and drain. Cut the leek into rings.

Cook the pasta very al dente. Just before the end of cooking time, add the leeks and cook, then drain the noodles and leeks.


Cut the mushrooms into thin slices. Heat oil in a skillet and sauté mushrooms over high heat, stirring little, until golden brown on all sides. Deglaze with soy sauce and set aside.

Finely dice the peppers and medium dice the tomatoes.

For the glaze, blend the tofu, cream, scrambled egg seasoning and garlic powder. Season generously with salt and pepper. Add chickpea flour, tapioca starch and agar and blend in as well.

Prepare the cheese glaze.

Mix the noodles, vegetables and glaze together and place in a baking dish. Cover with the cheese melt.

Bake in a preheated oven at 200 °C top/bottom heat for about 35 minutes until the bake is golden brown and the sauce has set.
