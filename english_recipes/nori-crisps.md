**1 serving**

---

- *1* sheet of nori
- *1* sheet of square rice paper
- *2 pinches* salt
- *1 pinch* MSG, optional
- *1 pinch* onion powder, optional
- Frying oil, enough for about 3 cm in the pot of your choice

---

Heat the oil in a pot to about 170 Â°C.

Meanwhile, place a sheet of nori, rough side up, on a board. Sprinkle with the desired spices. Put some water in a spray bottle. Have a sheet of rice paper ready. Spray the nori sheet with water until the surface is just damp, and immediately place the sheet of rice paper on the nori sheet with the smooth side facing the nori and press firmly. Turn over and allow to dry briefly.

When the oil is hot, cut the prepared cracker into small pieces with kitchen scissors, for example into 16 squares and then each square into two triangles.

Add crackers one at a time to the hot oil (they like to stick together at the very beginning) and fry until they sizzle less loudly (5 seconds to a minute, depending on your preference). They should immediately puff up and turn white when dropped into the fat, if they don't, the fat isn't hot enough yet. To prevent them from curling up into a ball, you can drop them Nori side down onto the oil and then immediately submerge them with a suitable tool until they are hard after about three seconds.

Lift crackers out of the fat with a slotted spoon and drain on some kitchen paper.
