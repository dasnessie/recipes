Add oatmeal mixture to margarine and stir in by hand.

Stir in water until dough is crumbly but rolls easily into balls and all ingredients are moist.

Add raisins and walnuts and mix in.

Preheat oven to 160Â°C convection.

Place dough in about tablespoon-sized portions on a baking sheet and flatten.

Bake in oven for about eight minutes, until edges are lightly browned and surface looks dry. Let cool briefly, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.
